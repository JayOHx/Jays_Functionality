# Jays_Functionality (ESX)
This is my first attempt at a resource for ESX based servers, it is essentially a utility script that brings all commonly used scripts into one place, this is usefull for those owners that struggle with resource count limitation that some server providers enforce. 

This is FREE, if anyone is seen to be selling this please tell me.


# Current v1.0a features: (VERY LIMITED)
  1. Ping command for users to ping themself and other players for latency checks (Can be disabled in the config.lua).
  2. Hands Up feature.
  3. Point Finger feature.
  4. Crouch Feature
  5. Population Control (Still testing this)

# INSTALLATION:
  1. Download the ZIP file
  2. Remove '-main' from the file name
  3. Upload to your server resources
  4. Done.

Use this link to find the number relating to the keys you want for changing the keybinds https://docs.fivem.net/docs/game-references/controls/ - I do not intend on adding a key table because I hate them but if you want to modify and re-upload with one, feel free

# CONFIG:
  1. Everything is lablled in the config.lua for easy use.
  2. If you have any issues feel free to join my personal discord below.

# FUTURE PLANS FOR THIS:
Next in mind is to change the way the point finger animation is triggered. (Moving away from shitty threads)

# CREDITS WHERE DUE:

The finger point anim was pulled from redoper1's FiveM-FingerPoint script and modified slightly to fit my needs.

I would like to use this space to thank a friend of mine, MrNewb, I am still fairly new to the FiveM/lua game and he is guiding me through and teaching me new things so alot of the updates coming for this resource are indirectly from him :) .

# Latest Changes if your interested:
1. Removed some features that will be put back in time, just using this as an moment to clean everything up into a tidy package.
2. Removed 2 threads in favour of keymapping with teaching from the amazing MrNewb
3. Disabled the ability to put hands up while in a vehicle, it looks super weird but might change to just the driver being disabled.
