# Jays_Functionality (ESX)
This is my first attempt at a resource for ESX based servers, it is essentially a utility script that brings all commonly used scripts into one place, this is usefull for those owners that struggle with resource count limitation that some server providers enforce. 


# Current v1.0a features: (VERY LIMITED)
  1. Ability to reduce/disable AI population count.
  2. Ability to disable default GTA V vehicle radio.
  3. Built in client and consol 'debug' this only displays your config settings.
  4. Ping command for users to ping themself and other players for latency checks (Can be disabled in the config.lua).
  5. Hands Up feature.
  6. Point Finger feature.
  7. Crouch Feature

# INSTALLATION:
  1. Download the ZIP file
  2. Remove '-main' from the file name
  3. Upload to your server resources
  4. Done.

Use this link to find the number relating to the keys you want for changing the keybinds https://docs.fivem.net/docs/game-references/controls/ - I do not intend on adding a key table because I hate them but if you want to modify and re-upload with one, feel free

# CONFIG:
  1. Everything is lablled in the config.lua for easy use.
  2. If you have any issues feel free to join my personal discord below.

# FUTURE PLANS FOR THIS:
I plan on removing the dependency for threads in the near future and also either removing or reducing my debuG feature as I feel its a bit cluncky and weird. I plan on either incorperating Discord Logs into it for maybe the hands up feature, I feel this could be usefull for Fail RP scenes to do with robberies etc but its something to thing about if it's worth doing especially for such a medecore script.

I also plan on adding more features to this in the coming weeks to make it more ideal for people with different needs, my main goal is to reduce timings as much as possible and have this resource have little to no impact in terms of latency etc.
